Using linearly polarized light we execute the BB84 protocol for quantum
 cryptography.
 The protocol is examined when no eavesdropper is present and a key is transmitt
ed securely between two agents.
 The results are compared with a simulation of the system.
 As the BB84 protocol uses quantum mechanics, an eavesdropper cannot measure
 the signal without altering it and so they are detected.
 Detection of an eavesdropper under the BB84 is also examined and the results
 are compared with a simulation of the system.

 In this experiment the polarization of light transmitted between the two
 communicating users, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bob
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is used to signify 0 and 1.
 The light can be polarized and measured in two different bases, 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

.
 In the 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 basis, light can be linearly polarized at either 
\begin_inset Formula $0\text{°}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $90\de$
\end_inset

, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{0\de}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{90\de}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 These polarizations are by definition orthogonal 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Should the reader know why that is significant yet?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{0\de}$
\end_inset

 can denote '1' and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{90\de}$
\end_inset

 can denote '0' without the two mixing.
 In the 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 basis, light can be polarized at either 
\begin_inset Formula $45\de$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-45\de$
\end_inset

, denoted similarly by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{45\de}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{-45\de}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 These polarizations are orthogonal too, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{45\de}$
\end_inset

 denotes '1' and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{-45\de}$
\end_inset

 denotes '0' when the light is measured in this basis.
 Using linear algebra it can be shown that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Ket{45\de}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\Ket{0\de}+\Ket{90\de})\,;\Ket{-45\de}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\Ket{0\de}-\Ket{90\de})\label{eq: Relation between X basis to + basis}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and similarly from these relations it can be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Ket{0\de}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\Ket{45\de}+\Ket{-45\de})\:;\Ket{90\de}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\Ket{-45\de}-\Ket{45\de})\label{eq: Relation between + basis to X basis}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Based on the quantum mechanical treatment of the polarizations, the relations
 above indicate that measuring the polarization of light that was polarized
 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 basis in the 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 basis has an equal probability of yielding either '0' or '1', and vise-versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
BB84
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BB84 encryption protocol makes use of the two different bases that share
 the relations in equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Relation between X basis to + basis"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Relation between + basis to X basis"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The protocol is as follows: one of the communicating users, Alice, chooses
 a basis (either 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

) at random.
 Alice then chooses a bit in that basis (either 0 or 1) and transmits a
 photon with the corresponding polarization in the basis she has chosen.
 Independently, the second user, Bob, chooses a basis at which he measures
 the polarization of the transmitted photon.
 Upon measurement, Bob documents the result (either 0 or 1) and the basis
 at which he chose to measure the polarization, while Alice documents the
 basis and bit she chose to transmit.
 The two users repeat this step many times.
 Alice and Bob then go through their measurements and compare the bases
 they have chosen for each measurement.
 They then discard the measurements in which Alice and Bob have chosen different
 bases and keep only those that have the same basis.
 Alice and Bob then publicly compare bits from a sample group chosen at
 random from the remaining measurements.
 In an ideal communication channel that is not eavesdropped on, they expect
 all the bits to be the same (i.e if Alice sent a 1 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 basis and Bob chose to measure in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 basis he is guaranteed to get a 1 too) and thus from the remaining bits
 that they have not compared they will form the key with which they will
 now encrypt and decrypt data from each other.
 However, if there is an eavesdropper, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eve
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, spying on their communication, she will inevitably interfere with the
 transmission, allowing us to intercept her.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $25\%$
\end_inset

 of the bits they compare (which as mentioned above, were all transmitted
 and measured in the same basis) will turn out different, indicating the
 existence of Eve due to the errors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

she will measure the signal, and as we know from quantum mechanics, this
 will change it, allowing us to intercept the eavesdropper.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose Eve is eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob.
 Eve receives the polarized photon from Alice.
 Suppose that Bob and Alice have both chosen the same basis in that measurement,
 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 and that Alice transmitted a 1.
 At a probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$
\end_inset

 Eve will choose the 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 basis, leading to a correct measurement of the polarization.
 She will then replicate the result by choosing the basis with which she
 has measured the polarization, to transmit to Bob a photon polarized in
 that basis at a state corresponding to the bit she measured.
 In this case, she will transmit the exact same polarization to Bob, which
 will then receive exactly what Alice tried to transmit, leaving Eve undetected
 in this case.
 In the other 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$
\end_inset

 of the cases, Eve will choose the wrong basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

.
 She will then transmit the photon with a polarization in that wrong basis,
 therefore, when Bob will measure the polarization in 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$
\end_inset

 of the cases he will get a 1 and on the remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$
\end_inset

 of the cases he will get a 0.
 Therefore, despite choosing the exact same basis as Alice, in 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%\times50\%=25\%$
\end_inset

 of the cases he will measure the wrong bit because of Eve.
 Consequently, if 
\begin_inset Formula $25\%$
\end_inset

 of the compared bits turn out to be different from each other, Bob and
 Alice can detect Eve and cease communication on that channel.
 As we have shown here, BB84 allows its users to either detect an eavesdropper
 or to safely form a key with which they will communicate safely.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Half-Wave Plate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have seen above, the protocol heavily relies on the ability of its
 users to transmit and measure photons with different polarizations.
 In this experiment this will be done using half-wave plates, also known
 as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

polarization rotator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A polarization rotator rotates the polarization of the incident light by
 double the physical rotation angle of the wave plate, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (see Figure

\begin_inset Formula $45\de$

, the light will be rotated to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{90\de}$
\end_inset

 state.

\begin_layout Part*
Experimental Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment consists of two parts.
 The first part contains only Alice and Bob communicating a key to each
 other without the existence of an eavesdropper on the channel.
 For the second part we add Eve, the eavesdropper.
 We then check if the BB84 protocol enables us to detect Eve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
First Part
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental setup of the first part consists of two units.
 The first unit 'belongs' to Alice and is capable of transmitting light
 with different linear polarizations according to the two bases 
\begin_inset Formula $+,\times$
\end_inset

.
 The second unit belongs to Bob and is capable of detecting the light and
 measuring its polarization (see Figure

Alice's unit uses a single photon source 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ask Gary about this
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that produces vertically polarized light (
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{0\de}$
\end_inset

).
 The light then goes through a polarization rotator which can change the
 polarization of light to one of four angles at the two different bases:
 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{0\de},\Ket{90\de}$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{45\de},\Ket{-45\de}$
\end_inset

).
 In this method Alice is capable of transmitting bits of information in
 the two bases required for the protocol.
 Bob then chooses a basis of measurement by rotating the polarization of
 the incident light at either 
\begin_inset Formula $0\de$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-45\de$
\end_inset

.
 The polarized light then goes through a polarizing beamsplitter (PBS) that
 transmits the horizontal component of polarization (
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{90\de})$
\end_inset

 and reflects the vertical component (
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{0\de}$
\end_inset

).

\end_inset

 allows Bob to measure the polarization in the two different bases.
 For example, if Alice transmits 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{45\de}$
\end_inset

 (a 1 bit in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 basis) and Bob rotates the polarization by 
\begin_inset Formula $-45\de$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Why is this a minus? I guess it's the only way the whole 0 and 1 thing works,
 but shouldn't we explain it?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (measuring in 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 basis) the light will turn to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{0\de}$
\end_inset

.
 It will then be reflected by the PBS and Bob will measure a 1 as required.
 If Bob measures in the 
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

 basis the polarization of the light will not change.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ket{45\de}$
\end_inset

 consists of vertical and horizontal components in equal magnitude (according
 to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Relation between X basis to + basis"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) half the time Bob will measure a 1 and in the other half he will measure
 a 0.
 We have thus shown that the composition of Bob's unit allows him to perform
 all the operations required of him according to the BB84 protocol.
 In this part of the experiment Alice sends to Bob three sequences of bits
 with varying lengths (18,50 and 100 bits), the bits that were sent and
 received with the same basis form the key, upon comparison we expect no
 errors as the system is ideal with no eavesdropper.

Second Part

\begin_layout Standard
We now add an eavesdropper to the communication channel, Eve.
 Eve detects the photon transmitted by Alice and measures its bit in a randomly
 chosen basis.
 Eve then replicates the measured bit and transmits it to Bob in the same
 basis she measured in.
 To perform these operations according to the protocol, Eve's units is a
 combination of Alice's and Bob's units (see Figure

As mentioned in a previous section, the length of the key is determined
 by the number of bits that were transmitted by Alice in the same basis
 as the one Bob used to measure them, leading to its correct interpretation
 (meaning that if Alice transmitted a '1' Bob also measured a '1').
 According to our model, the probability Alice and Bob chose the same basis
 for a certain bit is 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$
\end_inset

.
 In both the experiment and simulation it appears that the length of the
 key is close to the expectancy according to the model (which is half of
 the sequence length).
 Moreover, in the experiment and simulation all the bits that were measured
 and transmitted in the same basis by Bob and Alice respectively were correctly
 interpreted.
 This is exactly as the model predicts and as we require for the protocol
 to work (in its most ideal case, in reality communication errors can and
 will occur, but the protocol can still allow its users to deduct the existence
 of a spy).
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I'm not 100% sure about this phrasing.
 The protocol obviously prefers that there are no errors due to communication
 problems but even if there are some and like 6% of the bits have errors
 even though they were measured in the same basis we can still deduce the
 existence of an eavesdropper.
 What do you think? I think the phrasing is fine

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this experiment we communicated via the BB84 protocol.
 In the first part of the experiment there was no eavesdropper, which allowed
 Alice and Bob to form a key successfully according to the protocol.
 The key consisted of about half the bits transmitted, in accordance with
 our theoretical model.
 Moreover, no errors were spotted in the comparison of SBBs, yet again in
 accordance with theoretical results for the case of no eavesdropper.
 The simulation has also demonstrated similar results.
 In the second part an eavesdropper, Eve, was added.
 The BB84 protocol allowed us to detect Eve, because for all three sequences
 transmitted from Alice to Bob there were errors in the comparison of SBBs.
 For the sequence of 18 and 100 transmitted bits the percentage of errors
 compared to the number of SBBs was either 25% or close to it.
 However, for the sequence of 50 bits the percentage was at about 17%, which
 is not as close to 25%.
 To asses this result, we used a binomial distribution whose probability
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

failure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is 25%, relying on the theoretical model.
 We have shown that the probability of getting three errors out out of 18
 is greater than our set significance level of 5%.
 In addition the expected variance in the ratio of errors was estimated
 using simulations and our measurement of 17% 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
added of 17%
\end_layout

\end_inset

is 
\begin_inset Formula $1.8$
\end_inset

 standard deviations from 
\begin_inset Formula $25\%$
\end_inset

 which is in the desired range of 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 deviations.
 Therefore the theoretical model remains valid.
 We have also shown, using the simulation, that the percentage of errors
 converges to 25% for longer and longer sequences of transmitted bits, just
 as the model predicts.
 The simulation demonstrated similar results that are, too, in agreement
 with the model.
 The results we have achieved are in accordance with a previous experiment
 examining the BB84 protocol.
 The experiment obtained a percentage of errors close to zero in the absence
 of an eavesdropper and a percentage close to 25% in the presence of Eve
