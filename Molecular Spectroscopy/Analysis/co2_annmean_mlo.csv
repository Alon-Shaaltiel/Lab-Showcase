# USE OF NOAA GML DATA,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,
# These data are made freely available to the public and the,,,,,,,,
# scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination,,,,,,,,
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.,,,,,,,,
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication,,,,,,,,
# of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to,,,,,,,,
# ensure that GML receives fair credit for their work.  If the data,,,,,,,,
# are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation,,,,,,,,
# GML should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.,,,,,,,,
# If the GML data are essential to the work, or if an important,,,,,,,
# result or conclusion depends on the GML data, co-authorship,,,,,,,
# may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in,,,,,,,,
# the work.  Manuscripts using the GML data should be sent to GML,,,,,,,,
# for review before they are submitted for publication so we can,,,,,,,,
# ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately,,,,,,,,
# represented.,,,,,,,,

# RECIPROCITY,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.,,,,,,,,
# Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their,,,,,,,,
# own data available to the general public and to the scientific,,,,,,,,
# community in an equally complete and easily accessible form.,,,,,,,,
# Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community,,,,,,,,
# upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation,,,,,,,
# of the GML data, namely well documented model code, transport,,,,,,
# fields, and additional information necessary for other,,,,,,,
# scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.,,,,,,,,
# Model availability includes collaborative support for new,,,,,,,,
# users of the models.,,,,,,,,

# Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling,,,,,,,,
# of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the,,,,,,,,
# Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,
# The estimated uncertainty in the annual mean is the standard deviation,,,,,,,,
# of the differences of annual mean values determined independently by,,,,,,,,
# NOAA/ESRL and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,,,,,,,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality,,,,,,,
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same,,,,,,,
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.,,,,,,,,
