abstract = {Summary Polarization plays an important role in the interaction of light with matter attested to by the following examples: The amount of light reflected at the boundary between two materials depends the polarization of the incident wave. The amount of light absorbed by certain materials is polarization dependent. Light scattering from matter is generally polarization sensitive. The refractive index of anisotropic materials depends on the polarization. Waves with different polarizations therefore travel at different velocities and undergo different phase shifts, so that the polarization ellipse is modified as the wave advances. This property is used in the design of many optical devices. So-called optically active materials have the natural ability to rotate the polarization plane of linearly polarized light. In the presence of a magnetic field, most materials rotate the polarization. When arranged in certain configurations, liquid crystals also act as polarization rotators. This chapter is devoted to elementary polarization phenomena and a number of their applications. Elliptically polarized light is introduced using a matrix formalism that is convenient for describing polarization devices. The effect of polarization on the reflection and refraction of light at the boundaries between dielectric media is described. The propagation of light through anisotropic media (crystals), optically active media, and liquid crystals are the subjects of later sections respectively. Finally, basic polarization devices (polarizers, retarders, and rotators) are discussed.}}

 abstract = {The recent availability of internal tobacco industry documents provides a significant resource for evaluating industry understanding of the pharmacological, psychosocial, and behavioral mechanisms underlying tobacco dependence. In this study, we catalog the range of efforts undertaken by tobacco manufacturers seeking knowledge of these mechanisms. Some areas of industry research, such as cellular and molecular studies of nicotine and its effects, are widely available in the open literature. Of greater interest are internal research projects that have demonstrated direct influence on product development. These include studies of smoker psychology and behavior, evoked-response studies of tobacco-delivered nicotine, the effects of sensory perception, dose-related effects, and the development of nicotine analogs and synergists. Our findings suggest extensive industry knowledge of mechanisms that determine smoker perception and behavior, and application of this knowledge in product development, including control of sensory response, uptake of nicotine, and product effects. Independent research recently has begun to consider the contributions of tobacco product ingredients and design factors to the determination of risk, severity, and prevalence of addiction. However, the application of these findings to cessation and treatment efforts is still quite limited. We conclude that clinical research would greatly benefit from further examination of the decades of knowledge accumulated by tobacco manufacturers.},

abstract={Growing evidence suggests that environmentally relevant elevations in CO2 (<5,000 ppm) may pose direct risks for human health. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations could make adverse exposures more frequent and prolonged through increases in indoor air concentrations and increased time spent indoors. We review preliminary evidence concerning the potential health risks of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant elevations in ambient CO2, including inflammation, reductions in higher-level cognitive abilities, bone demineralization, kidney calcification, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. This early evidence indicates potential health risks at CO2 exposures as low as 1,000 ppm---a threshold that is already exceeded in many indoor environments with increased room occupancy and reduced building ventilation rates, and equivalent to some estimates for urban outdoor air concentrations before 2100. Continuous exposure to increased atmospheric CO2 could be an overlooked stressor of the modern and/or future environment. Further research is needed to quantify the major sources of CO2 exposure, to identify mitigation strategies to avoid adverse health effects and protect vulnerable populations, and to fully understand the potential health effects of chronic or intermittent exposure to indoor air with higher CO2 concentrations.},
